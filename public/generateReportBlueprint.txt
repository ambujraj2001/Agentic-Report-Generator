You are an expert data analyst tasked with creating a comprehensive report blueprint. Based on the provided CSV headers and sample data rows, analyze the data structure and provide a detailed blueprint for generating an analytical report.

**ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **DATA STRUCTURE ANALYSIS**
   - Identify data types for each column (numeric, categorical, date/time, text, boolean)
   - Determine key identifiers and primary metrics
   - Identify relationships between columns
   - Assess data quality and completeness

2. **REPORT SECTIONS TO GENERATE**
   Based on the sample data provided, suggest specific report sections that would be valuable:
   - Executive Summary components
   - Performance metrics and KPIs
   - Trend analysis opportunities
   - Categorical breakdowns
   - Geographic or location-based analysis (if applicable)
   - Time-based analysis (if date columns exist)
   - Comparative analysis sections
   - Risk or anomaly detection areas

3. **CALCULATIONS AND METRICS**
   For each identified section, specify:
   - Count aggregations (total records, unique values)
   - Sum/average calculations for numeric fields
   - Percentage distributions for categorical data
   - Growth rates or trends (if time data exists)
   - Success/failure rates (if status fields exist)
   - Statistical measures (mean, median, mode, standard deviation)
   - Cross-tabulation opportunities

4. **VISUALIZATIONS RECOMMENDATIONS**
   Suggest appropriate chart types:
   - Tables for detailed breakdowns
   - Bar charts for categorical comparisons
   - Line charts for trends over time
   - Pie charts for distribution analysis
   - Scatter plots for correlation analysis
   - Heatmaps for multi-dimensional data

5. **KEY INSIGHTS POTENTIAL**
   Identify what business insights could be derived:
   - Performance patterns
   - Bottlenecks or issues
   - Success factors
   - Regional/categorical differences
   - Temporal patterns
   - Operational efficiency metrics

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Provide a structured blueprint in the following format:

```
